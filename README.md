First repository (lol)
Hi!
I'm Sanjeevani, a girl who's basically worse than a beginner in coding.
I'm not saying that beginners are the worst, so please don't take my words otherwise.
But, you get the point.
Why would I join GitHub then, you might ask.
Well, that's a long, long story for another day.
That's all for today.
Good day to y'all!
